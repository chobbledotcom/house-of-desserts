As I walked in, they had Micheal Jackson playing. This immediately convinced me that this was a place for a relaxed evening to enjoy with company. I had ordered the kinder bueno sunday to which I was given within 2 minutes of ordering which was given to me with a smile. Overall, very chilled seting with great decore that was clearly reminiscent of a carnival. Will be going again frequently.
