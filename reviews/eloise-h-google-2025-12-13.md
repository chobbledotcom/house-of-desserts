Went for the first time with my mum as we've been wanting to try it since it opened in the summer. They offer a wide range of dessert foods and drinks- my mum had a cup of tea and a banana waffle, I had a milkshake and nutella crepe. Service was excellent, very friendly staff, and cute decor inside.

The ONLY reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because there was an odd and VERY strong smell- it almost smelled like an oven cleaning process, or something plastic burning. It was genuinely quite unpleasant. Once our food was made, for a few minutes all we could smell was crepes and waffles cooking, but while we were eating the unpleasant smell started to return so we decided to just quickly leave as soon as we were finished. Once outside, we quickly realised that the smell was so strong it had stuck to us! My mum was saying she could smell it on her coat and in her hair, and as I write this I can still smell it on myself even though it's been several hours now.
Not sure if this was a one-off, as I can't see any other reviews that mention this. It's a shame because if not for this nauseatingly strong smell it would have been a perfect visit. I don't know if we were smelling an electrical appliance or if something had broken down but it was bad enough that unfortunately it's been the most memorable thing about the place.

Cannot fault the food or the service though!
