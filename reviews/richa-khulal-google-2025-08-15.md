Amazing staff so polite i was made to feel so welcomed, the desserts are 5 star i will definitely be returning, for the amount i paid and to what was served to me was incredible i got so much for my money. The flavors are insane i would strongly recommend for anybody that has been weather its too eat in or take away go and get your desserts from there. Sorry one more thing even our fur baby got spoilt with their amazing doggy ice cream, doggy chocolate and doggy donuts. So the whole family is covered including fur babies.
