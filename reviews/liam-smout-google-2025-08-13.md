Absolutely loved our visit to House of Desserts in Lutterworth! From the moment we walked in, the atmosphere was warm, inviting, and relaxedperfect for treating yourself or catching up with friends. The staff were genuinely friendly, attentive, and made the experience feel special.

We tried their signature warm waffles topped with strawberries, Nutella, and a scoop of rich vanilla ice cream they were warm, fluffy, and absolutely perfect, just as raved about in other reviews . The vegan brownie and ice cream option was a delightful surprise beautifully presented and bursting with flavor .

The shop also had fun touches like games available while waiting, making it feel playful and unique .

Thankyou guys ill be back over again !
